You have a couple of options. The easiest involve using the ErrorAction settings.

-Erroraction is a universal parameter for all cmdlets. If there are special commands you want to ignore you can use -erroraction 'silentlycontinue' which will basically ignore all error messages generated by that command.

If you want to ignore all errors in a script, you can use the system variable $ErrorAction and do the same thing: $ErrorActionPreference= 'silentlycontinue'
